                 <p>A hamburger is a food, typically considered a sandwich, consisting of one or more cooked patties—usually ground meat,
                     typically beef—placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan fried, grilled, smoked or flame broiled.

                    today's shawarma may also be turkey, beef, or veal. You can get different type of Shawarma from us.
